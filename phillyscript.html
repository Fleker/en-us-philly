                PhillyScript is a project that is meant to create a programming language that reflects
                the vernacular used by the people of Philadelphia. Additionally, it serves as a way to
                experiment with new ways to viewing and interacting with programming languages.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal of PhillyScript is to be highly symbolic, using a number of operators and introducing
                new ones in order to make the code easier to visualize rather than read as a straight set
                of words. The goal is to enable developers to write a code flow that can be read quicker.
                One of the key theories of this language is that concise code is readable code.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to make sure PhillyScript can run in any environment, it is designed to transpile to
                JavaScript, enabling it to run in a web browser or other applications on modern operating
                systems. Much like the word <em>jawn</em>, variables in JavaScript can represent any type
                dynamically.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can use the editor below to try out PhillyScript for yourself. Then you can view the
                JavaScript output and copy that into your application. The goal is to have full interop with
                JavaScript, meaning a developer can slowly port their code to PhillyScript without having to
                go all at once.

            <h5 class='cozy'>Custom Pipes</h5>
            <p>
                Node.js servers are asynchronous, so they are not designed to handle <em>return</em> calls.
                Instead, you are often passed a callback that you need to run in order to 'end' your function.
                To reduce boilerplate, PhillyScript introduces custom pipes. These allow a developer to predefine
                certain functions to run on a string that is represented in backticks.
            </p>
            <pre>
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.status(200).send('Hello World')
})
            </pre>

            <p>This can be simplified like as shown below, with transpiler directives:</p>

            <pre>
#``res.status(200).send($arg)`
// ...
app.get('/', () => {
    ``Hello World`
})
            </pre>

            <p>
                The transpiler will associate two backticks with your pre-defined function and replace
                later instances of the usage with your longer callback implementation.
            </p>

            <h5 class='cozy'>New assignment operator</h5>
            <p>
                One of the more common mistakes in programming is having one too few equal signs in a
                conditional. Instead of checking if <em>foo == bar</em>, you write the assignment
                <em>foo = bar</em>, which changes the value of foo and returns true always. To alleviate
                this issue, assignments in PhillyScript use a colon and an equal sign, akin to Go.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's important to note that a standalone equal sign will be removed by the transpiler, causing
                the resultant code to have syntax errors.
            </p>
            <pre>
jawn foo := 'bar'
foo := 'bars'
if (foo == 'bar') {
    // ...
}
            </pre>

            <h5 class='cozy'>Async/Await syntax</h5>
            <p>
                The new <em>async</em> and <em>await</em> features of JavaScript are convenient, but also
                feel shoved into the language for backwards compatibilty. If we could start from scratch, we
                could introduce some improvements to the way that asynchronous functions are written.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead of having to prepend every function call with await, you can now append each call
                with an octothorpe. This cleans up the syntax that you look at while making the appending character
                notably different from a semicolon.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead of having to denote each function as <em>async</em>, you can also use the octothorpe to
                denote that it is asynchronous.
            </p>
            <pre>
fun delayPromise {
    return new Promise(resolve => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            resolve();
        }, 2000);
    });
}

fun# wait {
    :) calling
    jawn* result := delayPromise()#
    :) result
    // Prints 'calling', then 'result' after a delay
}

wait()
            </pre>

            <h5 class='cozy'>Functions</h5>
            <p>
                Syntax for functions is slightly easier. In addition to defining async functions faster with
                the octothorpe, functions can be defined just with <em>fun</em>, because they are fun.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are also a few shortcuts for functions without parameters. Instead of explicitly mentioning
                that there are zero arguments, you can just define the implementation with curly brackets.
            </p>
            <pre>
fun x {
    return 0;
}

const y := {
    return 0;
}

fun z(arg1, arg2) {
    return 0;
}
            </pre>

            <h5 class='cozy'>Classes</h5>
            <h6>Constructors</h6>
            <p>
                Constructors are generally unchanged, as you still use the <em>new</em> keyword and then
                you pass parameters. However, if you are creating an object with the default constructor,
                which does not have any parameters, you can use a simplified form that includes the
                <em>@</em> symbol.
            </p>
            <pre>
boul A { }
jawn* x @ A
            </pre>

            <h6>Extending classes</h6>
            <p>
                Classes are typically based on a superclass with the <em>extends</em> keyword, but in PhillyScript
                this is replaced by arrow notation.
            </p>
            <pre>
boul A {}
boul B <- A {}
jawn* x @ B
:) ${ x ~ B }
// Prints true
:) ${ x ~ A }
// Prints true
            </pre>

            <h5 class='cozy'>Symbols (Atoms)</h5>
            <p>
                Symbols are a feature of the JavaScript language which enable values that are unique
                and have a value of their own name. They can be created with the <em>Symbol.for</em> and
                the <em>Symbol.keyFor</em> methods.
            </p>
            <p>
                To reduce the verbosity and make this feature easier to use, new syntax is added which
                is inspired from Elixir's <a href='https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/basic-types.html#atoms'>atoms</a>
                type.
            </p>
            <pre>
jawn* x := :hello
// Creates a new symbol of type hello
:) ${ :x: }
// Prints the key of the symbol, which is 'hello'
            </pre>

            <h5 class="cozy">Tilde</h5>
            <p>
                The tilde, ~, is a symbol that lives on the keyboard but is rarely used. It appears in
                a handful of languages like C++ but is otherwise unused. In this language the symbol is used
                in a number of situations.
                <ul>
                    <li>Fuzzy equality for floats</li>
                    <li>If a class is an instanceof another class</li>
                    <li>Destroying variables</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Float comparison can match two floats that are similar to one another by wrapping the Math.round
                function:
            </p>
            <pre>
jawn float1 := 4.1;
jawn float2 := 3.9;
:) ${ float1 ~~ float2 }
// Prints true
            </pre>

            <p>The <em>instanceof</em> method can be simplified with the tilde.</p>

            <pre>
boul A { }
boul B <- A { }
jawn b := new B()
:) ${ b~B }
// Prints true
            </pre>

            <p>The destruction of variables is not often necessary in JavaScript, as there is a garbage collector,
            but PhillyScript still makes it easier to destroy variables. This is equivalent to the
            <em>delete</em> command in JavaScript.</p>

            <pre>
jawn a := jawns(1,2,3);
:) ${ a[1] }
// Prints 2
~a
:) ${ a[1] }
// Throws an error
            </pre>

            <h5 class="cozy">String and array range accessors</h5>
            <p>
                The <em>slice</em> method can quickly grab part of a string or an array, but this method
                can be accessed faster using array accessors, which is inspired from Python's accessors.
            </p>
            <pre>
jawn* a := 'Hello world'
:) ${ a[2:5] }
// Prints llo
jawn* b := jawns(1,2,3,4)
:) ${ b[1:3] }
// Prints [2,3]
            </pre>
            <p>
                This also enables you to ignore one of the boundaries to default to either the start
                or the end of the item if that argument is not included.
            </p>
            <pre>
jawn* a := jawns(0,1,2,3,4,5)
:) ${ a[:3] }
// Prints [0,1,2]
:) ${ a[3:] }
// Prints [3,4,5]
            </pre>

            <h5 class='cozy'>Array arithmetic</h5>
            <p>
                While you can easily add and multiply individual numbers, you can't do that easily to
                a whole array of numbers in standard JavaScript. A new language feature is dot or item-iterative
                arithmetic, which will apply the operation to every item in the array. These operations do not
                happen in place; they return a new array.
            </p>
            <pre>
jawn* a := jawns(0,1,2,3,4,5)
:) ${ a .* 5 }
// Prints [0,5,10,15,20,25]
:) ${ a .+ 2 }
// Prints [2,3,4,5,6,7]
:) ${ a[4:5] .% 3 }
// Prints 1
            </pre>

            <h5 class="cozy">Additional math operations</h5>
            <h6>Integer/Remainder division</h6>
            <p>
                In some math applications, you want to do integer divison, where 5/2 is going to result
                in 2, since you only want the integer part. At the same time, you may want the remainder
                of that operation. A new math operation, <em>//</em> will return an array with both the
                integer and the remainder.
            </p>
            <pre>
jawn* result := 5 // 2
:) ${result}
// Returns [2, 1]
            </pre>

            <h6>Factorial</h6>
            <p>
                The factorial expression is one in which a number factorial is the product of itself along
                with every positive integer less than itself. It is not part of the standard JavaScript math
                library, but it is now a built in feature of the language.
            </p>

            <pre>
:) ${ 5! }
// Prints 120
            </pre>

            <h6>Magnitude greater than/less than</h6>
            <p>
                In math, the sign <em>≫</em> and <em>≪</em> are used for 'much greater-than' and 'much less-than'.
                Although these inequalities are not features of JavaScript, they have been implemented in this
                language for easier checking of magnitude. In this specification, a number is said to be
                much greater-than if it is at least 10 times as large. This can be exclusive with the symbol
                <em><<</em> or inclusive with the symbol <em><<=</em>.
            </p>
            <pre>
jawn* a := 10
jawn* b := 100
jawn* c := 101
:) ${ c >> a }
// Prints true
:) ${ b >>= a }
// Prints true
:) ${ a << c }
// Prints true
            </pre>
            <p>
                A custom magnitude can be specified by inserting the magnitude between the carats.

            <h6>Bit-Shifting</h6>
            <p>
                As the double carat sign is now used for much greater-than and much less-than, the bit-shifting
                operators are now represented by a dot in front of carats.
            </p>
            <pre>
:) ${ 2 .<< 4 }
// Prints 32
:) ${ 32 .>> 4 }
// Prints 2

            <h5 class='cozy'>Maybe</h5>
            <p>
                In our modern world, things are not always black and white. Sometimes the truth is somewhere in
                the middle. As such, a simple `true`/`false` boolean may not always be what you want. Instead,
                your data may be one or the other. Like Schrodinger's cat, it may be both at the same time.
            </p>
            <p>
                A third value can be used for a boolean, `maybe`. By assigning a variable to be `maybe`, it
                is both true and false. It only becomes one of the two once the variable is observed, such as
                if it is printed or used in a conditional.
            </p>
            <pre>
jawn* cat := maybe
if (cat) {
    :) Sometimes this is true
} else {
    :) Sometimes this is false
}
            </pre>

            <h5 class='cozy'>Logging</h5>
            <p class='cozy'>
                Logging is often used for debugging, and sometimes as output in command line applications.
                The entire command `console.log` doesn't do a great job describing the value of this
                output. If you're logging normal data, then it's probably a good value. If you log an
                error, it's a bad value. We can make this code more clear this way.
            </p>
            <pre>
:) Something good happened
:| Here's a warning
:( Something bad happened
            </pre>

            <p class='cozy'>
                The compiler converts the statements above to console.log, console.warn, and console.error
                respectively. These statements also support string templates, so you can do:
            </p>
            <pre>
:) Our output is ${output}
>:( Error: ${error}
            </pre>

            <h5 class='cozy'>Errors</h5>
            <p>
                When you run into a number of errors during programming, you're going to get angry.
                You can alleviate frustration using the `fak` keyword. Again, this will automatically
                incorporate string templates for you.
            </p>

            <pre>
jawn* cat := true
if (cat) {
    >:( Why is this true?
    fak! this should not be true
}
            </pre>

            <h5 class='cozy'>Haha, yeah</h5>
            <p>
                Not sure what is happening? You can just insert `haha, yeah` into your scripts. This doesn't
                do anything, but you can use it as a no-op if you're so inclined.
            </p>
            <pre>
